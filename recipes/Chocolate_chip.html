    <h1> The Best Chocolate Chip Recipe</h1>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        I call this "The Best Chocalate Chip Recipe" because it's
        got everything a cookie lover could ask for.
    </p>

    <p>
        With a texture that is slightly cripsy on the outside and chewy on the inside,
        it's definitely one to enjoy.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1/4 cups of flour</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt </li>
        <li> 1 cup of butter softened</li>
        <li> 3/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
        <li> 1 egg </li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla </li>
        <li> 2 cups of semisweet chocalte chips </li>
        <li> 1 cup of coarsely chopped nuts <strong>(if desired) </strong> </li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol type="i">
        <p>
        <li> Heat oven to 375Â°F. In small bowl, mix flour, 
             baking soda and salt; set aside.
        </li>
        </p>

        <p>
        <li> In large bowl, beat softened butter and sugars with electric mixer 
            on medium speed, or mix with spoon about 1 minute or until fluffy, 
            scraping side of bowl occasionally.
        </li>
        </p>

        <p>
        <li> Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth. Stir in flour 
             mixture just until blended (dough will be stiff). 
             Stir in chocolate chips and nuts.
        </li>
        </p>

        <p>
        <li> Onto ungreased cookie sheets, 
            drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls 2 inches apart.
        </li>
        </p>

        <p>
        <li> Bake 8 to 10 minutes or until light brown (centers will be soft). 
             Cool 2 minutes; remove from cookie sheet to cooling rack. 
             Cool completely, about 30 minutes. Store covered in airtight container.
        </li>
