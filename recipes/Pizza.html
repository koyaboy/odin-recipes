    </p>

    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 ounces pizza dough,</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>18 to 20 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>12 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh oregano <strong>(optional)</strong></li>
        <li>Flour for rolling and shaping dough</li>
    </ul>

    <h3> Steps </h3>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>
            <h4>Preheat the Oven:</h4> 
             <p>   Preheat oven to 500Â°F. If you are using a pizza stone, 
                preheat it in the oven for at least 20 minutes so it 
                is nice and hot as well.

            </p>
            
        </li>

        <li> <h4>Make the Sauce:</h4>
        <p>
        Stir together the ingredients for the sauce. 
        The sauce recipe makes just enough for one large pizza. 
        You can easily double it if you are making more than one pizza.
        </p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Roll out the dough:</h4>
        <p> Roll out dough on a lightly floured surface. If it's hard to roll, 
            let it rest for 5 minutes so it can come to room temperature. 
            For a large pizza, I like to roll my dough into 
            about a 14-inch diameter circle.
        </p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Add the toppings:</h4>
        <p>
            Transfer the dough to a lightly dusted pizza peel. Alternatively, 
            fit it into a large cast-iron. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Add sauce in a light layer all over 
            the pizza, leaving about 1/4-inch crust around the edges. 
            Chop half of the pepperoni and sprinkle it over the sauce. Top the 
            pizza with grated cheese and the rest of the pepperoni. 
            Season with black pepper.
        </p>
        </li>

        <li><h4>Cook the pizza:</h4>
        <p> With a <em> pizza stone </em>carefully slide pizza into the 
            center of the preheated pizza stone. Cook for 6 minutes, then 
            rotate the pizza halfway so it cooks evenly. Cook for 
            another 6-8 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and 
            charred in spots. 
        </p>
        
        </li>

        <li><h4>Slice and serve:</h4></li>
        <p>
            Use pizza peel to slide pizza out onto a cutting board. 
            Let the pizza rest for a minute and slice into pieces. 
            Season with fresh oregano <strong >(optional) </strong>. 
            Serve while warm with a side salad.
